# Putty Themes

TODO added screenshots.

Ideas:

  1. Sett Putty settings
      * set window size in Putty settings, Window, Columns/Rows 80 by 33
      * set window Title in Putty settings, Behavior, Window Title - use name of scheme
      * use font TODO at size TODO (Minimal effort for Windows users is Consolas (10 or 12) as it is available for Microsoft Windows platforms since Vista/7 and available in XP via Office (https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/12919#issuecomment-1712376115), alternative is to pick an Open Source font to make comparison with Linux terminals easier)
  2. use pyshow_colors2.py to generate screenshot
      * `export PS1='$ '`
      * `./pyshow_colors2.py` from current directory
      * Enter in `Cursor` and move cursor over `s`
  3. Decide if want to include Putty title/scrollbars? - Crop pixels size?
  4. save as PNG
